# hotel-revenue-analysis
Analysis of the three year booking and revenue data generated from a hotel chain. From the data we want to answer the following question;
Is the hotel revenue growing by year? as there are various types of hotel within the hotel chain, we can break down the revenue by the hotel type and the year. That will give us a fair idea of how the revenue is changing on a yearly basis by the hotel type. Which i presume can assist in better allocation of resources for improvements and renivation where necessary.
Is there a need to expand the parking lot? Within the last three years, has there been an increase inthe trend of guests arriving with cars?
What other trend can we identify from the data that was generated? Whats the change in the daily average rate? What clas ss of clients do we get the most? Is there a seasonality trend?
